1. Incremental synthesis run: no

   Reason for not running incremental synthesis : synth_design options have changed between reference and incremental


INFO: [Synth 8-7130] Flow is switching to default flow due to incremental criteria not met. If you would like to alter this behaviour and have the flow terminate instead, please set the following parameter config_implementation {autoIncr.Synth.RejectBehavior Terminate}
